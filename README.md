# Code repository for the Winter dilemma

In this repository you can find the supplementary code for our Winter Dilemma, proposed by Contreras et al., 2021.

You can find Python code for the implementation and plotting routines in the 'code' folder. 
In the 'notebooks' folder you can find Jupyter notebooks that created the figures as well as country-specific parameter files.
Models for specific countries are named accordingly.
The folders 'scripts' and 'datamodelruns' are used for the sensitivity analysis that is still to be updated.
